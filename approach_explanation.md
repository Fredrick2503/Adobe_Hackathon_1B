# Document Header Intelligence Engine

A lightweight, optimized system for structural header extraction from PDF documents. It combines layout-aware feature engineering, machine learning (LightGBM), and layout-aware models to identify and rank headings (H1, H2, H3).

##  Models and Feature Pipeline

### 1. **Header Classification**

| Model         | Type        | Input Features                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LightGBM      | Supervised  | - Font size, boldness, indentation, y-position, line spacing<br>- Section length |
| LogisticRegression  | Weak ensemble | Used in stacking or fallback                                    |

**Feature Engineering Includes:**
- Visual: font size, font weight (bold detection), page number
- Layout: indentation, spacing between lines
- Position: relative position (top of page = likely heading)
- Context: nearby words, uppercase ratio

##  Future Enhancements

- Integrate better sentence transformers for semantic section grouping
- Add multilingual support (CJK, RTL scripts) and Unicode normalization
- Use **whitespace, margin alignment**, and visual cues (e.g., lines, boxes)
- Implement GPT-based **section summarization and relevance scoring**
- Add support for **interactive PDF elements** and linked TOC reconstruction
- Enable **real-time PDF processing** for up to 5â€“10 documents/minute with GPU optimization

##  Conclusion

This system combines rule-based layout analysis and machine learning to reliably extract structural headers from PDF documents. By engineering layout features and leveraging supervised classification, it produces high-accuracy, structured outlines that can power search, navigation, summarization, and content understanding systems.

The design is modular, scalable, and optimized for both accuracy and performance, making it a strong base for document intelligence applications.
